## My process

I spent some time without doing the challenges because I was studying other things, so I decided to return.

In this one I had difficulties with the asymmetrical placement of the testimonials cards and rate cards, and I also couldn't handle the placement of the background images very well. They are ok for the Figma project viewports, but in the intermediate viewports they are quite offset.
